##### Paulo Tobar - PADI Instructor and co-owner

{{< figure src="img/about/Paulo_small-1.png" class="align-right full-width">}}

Paulo worked with the Scuba Iguana Agency for 15 years as a Dive Guide and Instructor, learning the skills required to take on the training of guests and, in time, new colleagues.  Today, he is renowned for his passion about the ocean and the care of divers.  He says, "Since I was little, our island's connection with the sea has been inspiring.  Playing on our local beaches, learning to freedive with friends, undertaking a DSD program with the Scuba Iguana Agency while I was at school, all of this led me to the love I have for adventure and the undersea world."  

*"I have long been involved in citizen science projects, as I like to contribute to the conservation of marine species and inspire divers to care for marine ecosystems.  This is the reason our dive operation has at its core the preparing of divers to participate in citizen science initiatives.  Our oceans need so see big changes in the future, with each diveer contributing through personal action.  I can provide a really practical example of this.  One of my favorite species, the hawksbill turtle is in danger of extinction, so I'm focused on photo identification of these turtles to expand our knowledge about their aggregation areas and estimated populations, to help improve the management and protection measures we take in reeghard to this species."*

##### Mateo Cruz - PADI Instructor and co-owner

Mateo was raised on Floreana Island in the south of the Galapagos archipelago.

Having been raised in an environment of exquisite marine flora and fauna since childhood, it is perhaps not surprising that this has fueled a deep love for the ocean and a desire to explore the mysteries beneath its surface.

Mateo qualified as a PADI diving instructor in 2018, in order that he could share his passion for the sea with others.  He says of his mission: 

*“I live to guide divers on exciting underwater expeditions, equipping them with the technical skills necessary to enjoy our extraordinary aquatic world."*

*"My commitment lies in ensuring that everyone who dives into the depths does so with total safety, confidence, and the guarantee of a unique and unforgettable experience."*

##### Daniel Guerrero - PBoat Captain and Rescue Diver

{{< figure src="img/about/Daniel_small-1.png" class="align-right full-width">}}

Daniel is from Santa Cruz island in the Galapagos.

He grew up with a strong connection to the sea thanks to his family, his own small boat IRA, and his friends in Bahía Academia.

With such an interest, it seemed natural to Daniel that he should start his working life as a crew mewmber on a large vessel serving the islands.  

After spending time on a variety of such ships, Daniel became interested in scuba and he found employment of day-dive boats, expanding his knowlege and skills until, eventually, he became a dive boat Captain. 

Today, Daniel's extensive knowledge of Galapagos diving helps us offer guests the perfect response to varying weather, current, and tidal conditions. 


Daniel's passion for the marine world has also led him to be a Rescue Diver - prepared for any emergency  :-)

Nick and Paul have known each other for many years and when not busy with work and their families they dive - Nick is a DM and Paul a Rescue Diver. Occasionally, they also collaborate, as ‘Nick and Paul Multimedia’, to produce websites and provide IT support to individuals and organisations working in the scuba sector.

Nick and Paul say:

 *"We have known the guys at Galapagos Dive Training and Conservation for some time now and are really pleased they have finally set up their own business.  Their skills and energy will greatly advance the scuba offer in the islands! Our best wishes to everyone associated with the new company!"*

For the techies out there, this website was built using Hugo and is hosted on Github Pages.
