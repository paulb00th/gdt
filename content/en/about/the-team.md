Nick and Paul have known each other for many years and when not busy with work and their families they dive - Nick is a DM and Paul a Rescue Diver. Occasionally, they also collaborate, as ‘Nick and Paul Multimedia’, to produce websites and provide IT support to individuals and organisations working in the scuba sector.

Nick and Paul say:

 *We have known the guys at Galapagos Dive Training and Conservation for some time now and are really pleased they have finally set up their own business.  Their skills and energy will greatly advance the scuba offer in the islands! Our best wishes to everyone associated with the new company!*

For the techies out there, this website was built using Hugo and is hosted on Github Pages. 

If you would like to contact Nick and Paul, use the email address in the website footer.
