1. **Responsibilities**
Galapagos Dive Academy is the direct operator for all Galapagos Dive Academy daily diving services. In regard to all land tours, hotels and apartment bookings, long range day diving activities and cruises, these are contracted through third parties and Galapagos Dive Academy acts only as an intermediary agent for passengers contracting with such service providers.
Galapagos Dive Academy takes no responsibility for accidents, loss, damage, delay, inconvenience, or any other irregularity that may be caused by defects of any vehicle, or through situations of omission, neglect or negligence of any of these third-party companies. Galapagos Dive Academy also accepts no responsibility for tour or service cancellations by third-party operators, as a result of vandalism, strikes, war, governmental actions, weather conditions, or other factors which imply additional expenses caused by delays, itinerary changes or other causes.
Galapagos Dive Academy reserves the right to accept or reject any request for reservation by any client, and to cancel or change a tour or accommodation package, if circumstances so warrant. The request for service to our company will be understood as a consent to these conditions.

2. **Prices and Rates**
All prices and rates are in US dollars and are subject to change without notice, until payment has been made and proper confirmation of availability and price issued.

Rates/fees do not include extras, tips, airport taxes, airfares (unless otherwise indicated), entrance fees to the national park or other islands, excess baggage or any other item not specified in the tour program.

3. **Itinerary**
Our itineraries are planned with great care, but for operational reasons, it may be necessary to change the order of activities in the itinerary or on the specified route.  Such cases are rare, however, in general, an itinerary should be treated as a basic guide only.
Galapagos Dive Academy reserves the right to make changes to the order of excursions/trips due to weather conditions, ocean tides, time of arrival or departure of aircraft, buses or boats, availability of tours and hotels, or for any other relevant reason, with the goal of enabling all activities in a stated tour package or diving tour to be completed.

The confirmation of hotels is subject to availability, if your specified hotel is not available for any reason, you will be provided with another in a similar category and price band.

10. **Travel & Dive Insurance**
Travel insurance / Dive Insurance is recommended for customers. Some travel insurance does include dive insurance whilst others categorise diving as an extreme sport and do not include it. We recommend that your travel insurance includes cover against personal accident, death, medical expenses, and emergency repatriation with a recommended minimum coverage of US $200,000 for each of the categories of cover. 
We also strongly recommend it covers cancellation, curtailment, personal liability and loss of luggage and personal effects. If you have travel insurance connected to your credit card or bank account, please ensure you have details of the participating insurer, the insurance policy number and emergency contact number with you, rather than just the bank’s name and credit card details.
