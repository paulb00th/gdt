#### Introduction

{{< figure src="img/G_ROCKS.png" class="align-right full-width-on-small" >}}

When **Galapagos Dive Academy** clients hold a PADI Advanced Open Water qualification or higher and have at minimum 25 logged dives, (or have amassed a comparable level of knowledge and experience) we collaborate with the best of the other scuba operators in town to widen the variety of sites that can be visited.  This ensures that our customers can experience the full breadth of the underwater world in the Galapagos as they explore our legendary archipelago.

If you were to dive with any one third party operator you would be tied to their weekly dive itinerary, as laid down by the National Park Authority.  However, by having us organize your schedule across a combination of the best operators, you get the best of dive experiences tailored to meet your personal dive aspirations.

*Please be aware that diving the island’s more remote sites requires longer travel times.  The two model itineraries set out below highlight the basics involved:*

**Model 1**
Between 07.00 and 08.00, you take a 45-minute car ride north from Puerto Ayora to the ‘Itabaca Channel’ close to Baltra Island.  From here the boat will depart to your selected destination/s (for example, Bartolome/Cousins, North Seymour/Mosquera, Mosquera/Daphne, Gordon Rocks).  The boat run time will varying between 25 minutes and 1 hour and 30 minutes in each direction, depending on the site/s you have nominated. 

**Model 2**
Your chosen destination/s is located to the south or east of Santa Cruz Island, (for example, Gordon Rocks, Santa Fe and Floreana), in which case, between 07.00 and 08.00, your boat will depart directly from the harbour in Puerto Ayora and the run time will be between 1 and 2 hours in each direction.

*In either circumstance, participants complete two dives during the trip and enjoy snacks during the dive interval and lunch at the end of the second dive.   You are generally returned to your accommodation between 15.30 and 16.00 hrs., depending on the destination and vessel involved.*

**For further detail about individual trips/trip combinations, please [Contact Us](/contact?message=Enquiry%20about%20Long-range%20day-diving).**

#### Notes
1) Young divers: It is mandatory in the Galapagos that 10- to 11-year-old Open Water certified children require a private guide on day trips, because they are certified to a maximum depth of 12 m/40feet, while the rest of the group will be diving to a minimum of 18 m/60feet. 
For 12- to 14-year-old certified children we still recommend booking a private guide, but this is optional. In the case that a private guide is not contracted, such children must be accompanied by a dive qualified adult family member.  For the advanced diving location Gordon Rocks [ANCHOR TO:  Gordon Rocks, below] special regulations apply. If further detail is required, ask us.

2) Gordon Rocks:  This dive site is very popular but can have strong currents. If your dive experience is limited, please arrange your dates so that you dive Gordon Rocks at the end of your trip rather than on your first day.
We reserve the right to cancel your diving at Gordon Rocks if our guides feel that your experience level is insufficient and that the trip would therefore be unsafe.

3) Non-Divers:  For members of your group who are not undertaking SCUBA, we can arrange non-diving tours and activities that will allow them to experience the extraordinarily diverse land animals and and magical places of our enchanted islands.

<I>With the above points in mind, please plan your diving tours considering both your own experience and that of your accompanying friends/family.</I>
