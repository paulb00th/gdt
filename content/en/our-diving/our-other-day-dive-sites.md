For experienced clients holding at minimum a PADI Advanced Open Water certification (or a comparable qualification) we widen the variety of dive sites we offer by collaborating with the best of the other scuba operators in Puerto Ayora.  If you were to dive with any one these third party operators, you would be tied to the dive itineraries each is set by the National Park Authority.  By allowing us to arrange your schedule, we can select the best options from each individual operator and design your dive experiences to meet your personal interests.

Please be aware:

*If you choose a dive destination to the south or east of Santa Cruz Island, your boat will depart directly from the harbour in Puerto Ayora between 07.00 and 08.00 and run times in each direction will be 1 and 2 hours.*

*If you choose a dive destination to the north or west of the Island you take a 45-minute car ride north from Puerto Ayora to the ‘Itabaca Channel’ close to Baltra Island, departing between 07.00 and 08.00.  Thereafter, your boat run time will varying between 30 minutes and 1 hour and 30 minutes in each direction, depending on the destination.*

Whichever route you select, you will complete two dives during the trip and enjoy snacks and refreshments during dive intervals. Regardless of the destination, you can generally expect to be back at your accommodation between 15.30 and 16.00 hrs.
