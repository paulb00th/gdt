Our Open Water Course is taught in two parts. The academic/theoretical component undertaken online, and the practical, hands-on component provided by us.  To become a PADI Open Water Diver you must successfully complete all of the training exercises.  Upon this, you will receive your certification, which permits you to dive to a maximum depth of 18m.

**Set out below is a little more information about how we generally stage the course (note, some timings are variable according to whether you select our AM or PM schedule):**

Students first complete the theory component of the course online (at home or in their hotel) using, for example, PADI’s E-learning tools.

Between 15.00 and 18.00 hrs on the day of your arrival we meet at our dive center so that you can check in with us, sign the required medical statement and release form, try-on the dive gear you will use, and meet your PADI instructor.
