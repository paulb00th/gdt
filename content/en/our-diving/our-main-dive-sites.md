### OUR TRAINING SITES

{{< figure src="img/our-diving/GDTtrainingSites.png" class="align-right full-width-on-small" >}}

<span class="strapline">Safe, sheltered and close to town</span>
 
We mostly conducted training dives in Academy Bay, which is adjacent to Puerto Ayora.  This town is our home base and the largest conurbation in the Galapagos.

We use four sites in the bay, all of which are shown on the map opposite.  

Each site is accessible within a 10-to-20-minute boat ride from our harbour and we offer daily trips at 08:00, 13.00, and 18.00 hrs, for 1 and 2 tank adventures. 

When we have novice divers with us, we always provide users with rope lines to assist with ascent and descent.

There are many locations at which you can dive in the Galapagos but none that offer new divers a better place to train and gain confidence!

#### PUNTA ESTRADA

Approximately 10 mins from Puerto Ayora and laying to the southwest side of the bay, this dive site is perfect for novice & reactivate students as well as for experienced divers, for whom it offers fabulous night diving.

Depth is between 6 m and 15 m, the bottom is flat and, while diving, it’s not unusual for clients to see a wide variety of reef fish along with rays, turtles, sharks, octopus, lobsters, and  varied other local creatures.

Let Punta Estrada enhance  your learning and enjoyment!

#### LOBERIA (Caamaño Islet)

Approximately 15 to 20 mins from Puerto Ayora and laying to the south side of the bay, this site is ideal for novice & reactivate students as well as for divers with advanced qualifications.

With a maximum depth of some 15 m, it’s common to see a wide variety of reef fish, sea lions, and rays in this area, which is one of the reasons Loberia is much used by Free Divers!

#### EL BAJO

Approximately 15 mins from Puerto Ayora and set to the southwest side of the bay this site is perfect for ‘advanced’ students & clients taking a re-activate course.

With a maximum depth of approximately 40 m, a seamount rises from El Bajo to some 10 m below the surface, meaning that clients can experience  both current and depth in a controlled environment.  Divers frequently see large pelagic animals such as hammerhead and reef sharks, alongside eagle rays, sea turtles, schooling fish and octopus.
