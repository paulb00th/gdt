{{< figure src="img/GDA-dive-sites2.png" class="align-right full-width-on-small" >}}

<span class="strapline">Selected, safe and sheltered locations close to our dive centre and the town</span>
 
Our Novice and Refresher diver training sessions are mostly conducted in Academy Bay, so named by the California Academy of Sciences during an expedition conducted in 1905.  Academia Bay lays aside Puerto Ayora, the largest town in the Galapagos, and is adjacent to the Charles Darwin Research Station.  This was founded in 1959 to preserve and study the fauna and flora of the Galapagos Islands.

The bay has four dive sites that are ideal for training and refresher purposes, all accessible within a 10-to-20-minute boat ride from the town’s main harbour.

We offer daily trips to the bay at 08:00, 13.00, and 18.00 hrs, for 1 and 2 tank adventures.  As required, we offer buoys with ropes, to assist with ascent and descent.

Set out below is a brief description of each site.
