<span class="strapline">Diving at its best </span>


{{< figure src="img/our-boats/our-boat4.png" class="align-right full-width">}}

The Galapagos islands most famous dive sites, such as Wolf and Darwin are not accessible when day diving. A liveaboard boat is the only way to experience these dramatic, but remote, locations.

Let us arrange your trip!  We have good relations with all of our specialised ultra-long-range dive boats, which offer a wide range of comfort levels and diving itineraries - we will find you the ideal solkution!

Just tell us if you want a Wolf and Darwin focused experiomce or one that takes in other remote sites and we’ll do the rest!

A selaction of the liveaboards we can provide are set out below. If you don't see what you're looking for, let us know, especially if you are looking for a last-minute price - Contact Us.

While visiting our northern most sites you should expect to see large schools of hammerhead sharks, especially during the warm season between January to May, whale Sharks between June and November, and Manta Rays between October and December. Throughout most of the year divers will see, dolphins, Galapagos sharks, silky sharks, Mola mola and white spotted eagle rays.

Long range boats are heavily booked throug the Whale Shark season, so we advise that you reserve your place/s at least a year in advance. 

Please note that liveaboard operators expect their clients to have significant dive experience, with most looking for between 50 and 100 dives in the recent past. 

PS - If you’re English speaking and would like to contact someone who has travelled on the Tiburon and Humboldt Explorers for an independant view of what's on offer, email Nick who helped develop this website, he’d be happy to share his thoughts and discuss how to organise your trip.
