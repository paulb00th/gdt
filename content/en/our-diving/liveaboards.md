<span class="strapline">Diving at its best </span>

The Galapagos island's most famous dive sites, such as Wolf and Darwin, are not accessible when day diving. A liveaboard boat is the only way to experience these dramatic, but remote, locations.

Why not let us arrange your trip?  We have great relations with all the operators running specialised long-range dive boats and can offer you a wide range of comfort levels and diving itineraries – let us find you the ideal solution!

Just tell us if you want, a Wolf and Darwin focused experience or one that takes in other remote sites too.  With your briefing to hand, we’ll do the rest!

A selection of the liveaboards we can provide is shown below. If you don’t see what you’re looking for, let us know, especially if you’re seeking a last-minute price.

To discuss or book a liveaboard, do please: Contact Us.

While visiting our northern most sites you should expect to see large schools of hammerhead sharks, especially during the warm season between January to May, whale Sharks between June and November, and Manta Rays between October and December.

Throughout most of the year divers will see, dolphins, Galapagos sharks, silky sharks, Mola mola and white spotted eagle rays.

Please note:

1 - Long-range boats are heavily booked throughout Whale Shark season, so we advise that you reserve your place/s at least a year in advance. 

2 - Liveaboard operators expect their clients to have significant dive experience, with most looking for between 50 and 100 dives in the recent past.11 

PS - If you’re English speaking and would like to contact someone who has travelled on long range Galapagos boats for an independent view of what’s on offer, email Nick who helped develop this website, he’d be happy to share his thoughts and discuss how to organise your trip. His email address is: nandpmultimedia@gmail.com.
