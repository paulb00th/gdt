### OUR BOATS



<span class="strapline">We offer only the best dive platforms </span>
 
<p>
The boats we make use of are all designed and equipped for comfort, safety, and seaworthiness.

Our own vessel, shown in the main photograph, is named the 'Maria Isabel'.  

Recently commissioned, she is configured specifically for training purposes in the calm waters of Academy Bay, where our key dive training sites are located.   

While Maria Isabel does not get taken very far from her regular mooring, you can always see exactly where we are on the water by looking us up on ‘vesselfinder.  The link to us is: https://www.vesselfinder.com/?mmsi=735058004  

Perhaps you can catch us while we're out on a training trip!

**To review the locations at which we provide training, see:**

If you select us as your provider for longer-range day diving, (an activity suitable for almost all advanced divers), we will only place you on the very best and most reliable vessels currently servicing the Santa Cruz area.  

Two examples of such boats are shown below.  These are operated by companies with whom we have very positive and long working relations, and whom we entirely trust to provide the highest quality of service.
