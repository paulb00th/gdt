### OUR BOATS



<span class="strapline">We offer only the best dive platforms </span>
Â 
<p>
The boats we use are all designed and equipped for comfort, safety, and seaworthiness.

Our own vessel, Maria Isabel, is configured specifically for training purposes in the calm waters of Academy Bay, where our key dive sites are located.

If you select us as your provider for longer-range day diving, (suitable for all advanced divers), we will only place you on the higher quality and more reliable vessels that service the Santa Cruz area.  Some of these boats are shown below.
