Â 
Our boats are designed and equipped for comfort, safety, and seaworthiness, in the conditions that prevail in the Galapagos. 

Our own vessel, NINA, which we use for novice and refresher courses, is 7 m long and powered by an outboard engine that helps us to easily navigate to and from dive sites we use for training but is eco-friendly by way of displacement/horsepower.   It has plenty of space for dry and wet storage and for kitting-up.

If you select us as your provider for longer-range day diving, (suitable for the more advanced diver), you will travel on a high-quality boat chosen by us for its comfort, safety, and good seakeeping.  Typically, the day boats we select are between 10 and 12 m length, are of fibre-glass construction, and are equipped with twin 200HP outboards and the following safetyy equipment: VHF radio, GPS, EPIRB, first-aid resources and oxygen.  The long-range vessels we use generally carry a maximum of 12 clients, offer a private head (sea toilet) and are usually staffed by a minimum of two guides/instructors, two crew members and a qualified captain.  

Set out below are three images of such boats, each of which we regularly use for clients.
