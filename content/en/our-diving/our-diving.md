#### Discover Scuba Diving (DSD)

<!-- xOur DSD program is designed to offer your first diving experience, under the supervision of a qualified PADI/SSI instructor.  Let the team at **Galapagos Dive Academy** introduce you to the equipment and techniques you will use while in the underwater world - with our focus on safety always to the fore.  

**To join us for a DSD experience you must:**

<blockquote>
<p>Be a minimum of 10 years old</p>

<p>Know how to swim</p>

<p>Be free of heart disease, advanced respiratory disease, and any temporary congestion, such as influenza (flu)</p>

<p>Please note: If you are 60 or older, or if you are suffering from any type of significant illness, a medical certificate is recommended to confirm your fitness for diving</p>
</blockquote>

Our DSD adventure is held in the bay directly adjacent to our Puerta Ayora office and teaching centre, at the dive site named [Punta Estrada](/our-diving/our-main-dive-sites).  During your experience we will aim to take you to a maximum depth of 12m for about 45 minutes.  Please bear in mind that the actual time you will spend underwater depends on your breathing pattern, so start practicing long slow breathing techniques today!  We offer daily morning and afternoon trips (8 AM and 1 PM start times) with an instructor catering to each candidate or pair of candidates, up to a maximum of 4 participants assisted by 2 instructors.

#### Open Water Course

If you want to progress your SCUBA training, perhaps after a DSD, you can take our Open Water course.  

Being certified to breathe underwater is like having a superpower.  With this capability you can explore the world’s aquatic ecosystems and discover thousands of marine species, from tiny life forms such as nudibranchs to the largest of sharks, rays, dolphins and whales.  **Uniquely, while training with us, you will also learn the about citizen science initiatives designed to care of these ecosystems, and how you can contribute to them (*).**  Our Open Water course is certainly something you will never forget!

Minimum age: 10 years old.
Maximum depth: 18 meters.
Requirements: Able to swim, free of heart disease, advanced respiratory disease, and any temporary congestion, such as influenza (flu).
Please note:  If you are 60 or older, or if you are suffering from any type of significant illness, a medical certificate is recommended to confirm your fitness for diving
Schedule: daily morning and afternoon trips (7:30 am to 12 pm / 1:30 pm to 5 pm).

**Program:** Open Water is the most popular PADI program worldwide and is taught in two sections.  The first part is academic and conducted with easy to access online materials.  This section can be undertaken in your own time, at home or, while you are in the Galapagos.  The second part is a mix of confined (pool-based) and open water practical training, during which you learn how to handle scuba equipment and become an independent diver.  This section usually takes 3 days to complete and provides for a total of 4-dives in the sea.  Following certification, you will be qualified to dive a maximum depth of 18m.

We teach the open water part of the course in Academy Bay at several sites, including Punta Estrada, Loberia, El Bajo, and El Barranco.

Our instructors take no more than four adult candidates at a time (or a maximum of five adult participants when assisted by two instructors).  Children aged 10 to 12 years are taught in smaller groups.

PADI Registration: Upon successful completion of the course, participants receive Open Water Diver certification  from PADI - a lifelong qualification.

As far as the practical in water sessions go, both pool training and open water dives take place in the morning or afternoon, according to your availability.  When you’re ready to for the sea, you will most likely undertake two dives per day, over two days.

On day 1 you will dive to a depth of 12 metres/40 feet.

On day 2 you will go down to 18 metres/60 feet which is the maximum depth that Open Water certified divers.

**Sightings:**  During the programme you will observe a great variety of animals including marine invertebrates, such as molluscs and crustaceans, and reef dwellers such as parrot fish, damselfish, jacks, cod, and scorpion fish.  You may also spot moray eels, sea turtles, different species of rays, sea lions, and sharks.  If circumstances allow and you conduct you final two dives outside of  the bay, you may have the opportunity to see a wide variety of sharks and rays, depending on the site you visit.

**Certification:** Once you have passed the Theory and Practical sessions involved, you will receive your Padi Open Water Diver License, this is valid for life and your passport to underwater adventure!
