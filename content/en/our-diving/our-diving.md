#### Discover Scuba Diving (DSD)

<!-- Our DSD program is designed to offer your first diving experience, under the supervision of a qualified PADI/SSI instructor.  Let the team at **Galapagos Dive Academy** introduce you to the equipment and techniques you will use while in the underwater world - with our focus on safety always to the fore.  

**To join us for a DSD experience you must:**

<blockquote>
<p>Be a minimum of 10 years old</p>

<p>Know how to swim</p>

<p>Be free of heart disease, advanced respiratory disease, and any temporary congestion, such as influenza (flu)</p>

<p>Please note: If you are 60 or older, or if you are suffering from any type of significant illness, a medical certificate is recommended to confirm your fitness for diving</p>
</blockquote>

Our DSD adventure is held in the bay directly adjacent to our Puerta Ayora office and teaching centre, at the dive site named [Punta Estrada](/our-diving/our-main-dive-sites).  During your experience we will aim to take you to a maximum depth of 12m for about 45 minutes.  Please bear in mind that the actual time you will spend underwater depends on your breathing pattern, so start practicing long slow breathing techniques today!  We offer daily morning and afternoon trips (8 AM and 1 PM start times) with an instructor catering to each candidate or pair of candidates, up to a maximum of 4 participants assisted by 2 instructors.

Experience the magic of breathing underwater with Discover Scuba Diving (DSD). The DSD program does not offer a diving certification but rather an introductory dive experience, during which you learn the basic skills for safe and fun diving under the supervision of a Galápagos Dive Training PADI Instructor.

Minimum age: 10 years old.
Maximum depth: 12 meters.
Schedule: 8 am to 12 pm or 1:30 pm to 5 pm.

**Program:** Our DSD activity begins at our office (on the day of your DSD, or the day before, depending on the number of participants). There, you will initially watch a video and take a short class guided by an Instructor. Then, after trying on and selecting the right equipment, we will transfer to the dock and take our boat to the Punta Estrada dive site.

Following a briefing about the location, the 
facilities on our boat, water entry and exit techniques, dive safety, and the day’s conditions, we will conduct a confined open water session (maximum 5 meters in a protected area) where, with your instructor, you will practice buoyancy techniques and equipment use. Then, you will do our Punta Estrada Adventure Dive to a maximum depth of 12 meters / 40 feet.

**Sightings:**  During the program you will be able to observe a great variety of reef animals, including small marine invertebrates, mollusks, and crustaceans, parrot fish, goat fish, witch fish, damsel fish, cod, horse mackerels, moray eels, a variety of different ray species, white tip sharks, and Galapagos sharks. Sea turtles and sea lions are also likely to be present.
