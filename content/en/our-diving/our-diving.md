#### Discover Scuba Diving (DSD)

Our DSD program is designed to offer your first diving experience, under the supervision of a qualified PADI/SSI instructor.  Let the team at **Galapagos Dive Academy** introduce you to the equipment and techniques you will use while in the underwater world - with our focus on safety always to the fore.  

**To join us for a DSD experience you must:**

<blockquote>
<p>Be a minimum of 10 years old</p>

<p>Know how to swim</p>

<p>Be free of heart disease, advanced respiratory disease, and any temporary congestion, such as influenza (flu)</p>

<p>Please note: If you are 60 or older, or if you are suffering from any type of significant illness, a medical certificate is recommended to confirm your fitness for diving</p>
</blockquote>

Our DSD adventure is held in the bay directly adjacent to our Puerta Ayora office and teaching centre, at the dive site named [Punta Estrada](/our-diving/our-main-dive-sites).  During your experience we will aim to take you to a maximum depth of 12m for about 45 minutes.  Please bear in mind that the actual time you will spend underwater depends on your breathing pattern, so start practicing long slow breathing techniques today!  We offer daily morning and afternoon trips (8 AM and 1 PM start times) with an instructor catering to each candidate or pair of candidates, up to a maximum of 4 participants assisted by 2 instructors.

#### OPEN WATER COURSE

If you would like to progress your SCUBA training after your DSD experience, you can take an Open Water course - a lifelong qualification.  This is the most popular course worldwide, being designed so that the student can either start at home and finish on vacation or complete the entire course whilst on holiday. 
 
The Open Water course is in two parts. The first is academic and theoretical, and conducted with easy to access online materials.  You can undertake this section slowly at home or in just a few days while on vacation.  The second part is a mix of confined (pool-based) and open water practical training during which you learn how to handle scuba equipment and become an independent diver.  This section usually takes 3 days to complete and provides for a total of 4-dives in the sea.  Following certification, you are qualified to a maximum depth of 18m.
 
**To join us for an Open Water course you must:**
<blockquote>
<p>Be a minimum of 10 years old</p>
<p>Know how to swim</p>
<p>Be free of heart disease, advanced respiratory disease, and any temporary congestion, such as influenza (flu)</p>
<p>Please note: If you are 60 or older, or if you are suffering from any type of significant illness, a medical certificate is recommended to confirm your fitness for diving)</p>

We teach our Open Water course in Academy Bay, using several sites, these being:  [Punta Estrada](/our-diving/our-main-dive-sites), [Loberia](/our-diving/our-main-dive-sites), [El Bajo](/our-diving/our-main-dive-sites), and [El Barranco](/our-diving/our-main-dive-sites).

We offer daily morning and afternoon trips (8 AM and 1 PM start times) with an instructor catering to no more than four adult candidates (maximum of 5 adult participants assisted by 2 instructors).  Children aged 10 to 12 years are taught in smaller groups.

#### SCUBA DIVER COURSE

If your time is limited (or you were unable to complete your Open Water course for any reason), the Scuba Diver course might be just what you need.  You complete the same academic study as for the Open Water qualification, but the confined water practices and two open water dives are conducted in just 2 days.
 
Upon completion of the course, you will receive a digital certificate as a Scuba Diver which will allow you to descend, under the direct supervision of a professional, to a maximum depth of 12m/40ft.  Once you have the Scuba Diver qualification, you can complete Open Water training at any appropriate dive centre worldwide and thereby UPGRADE your qualification.

#### ADVANCED OPEN WATER

You can further progress your SCUBA training by taking the Advanced Open Water course.  This lifelong qualification, usually taught over 3 days, is designed to improve your technique and introduce you to new diving skills – building your experience, confidence, and capabilities.
 
The theory component of the course is taught digitally, with an extensive array of online materials allowing you to tailor your study. The practical component encompasses five blue water dives, the following two of which are compulsory: 
1)  A deep dive taking you and your PADI/SSI instructor far beyond the 18 m ‘Open Water’ limit.  During the preparation for this you will learn about how to plan for deep diving, so that it’s both safe and fun.
 
2)  An underwater navigation dive that will build on the skills learned during your ‘Open Water’ course and teach you about more complex navigational practice.  

The other three dives are chosen by the student from a range of ‘adventure’ specialties.  Amongst the most popular of these and the three we recommend are: 

3)  Peak Performance Buoyancy - our strongest recommendation.  A course geared to improving your control over descents and ascents, your position in the water and your breathing.  This activity will transform your diving experience for life!
 
4)  Night adventure - without doubt another of our absolute favourites  and a chance for us to show you the intriguing and wonderful creatures that come out of hiding after it’s dark.
 
5)  Multilevel adventure - the opportunity to learn more about dive planning and the use of dive computers.
You might also like to ask us about our Naturalist, Fish ID, Drift Dive and other adventure specialties.

At Galapagos Dive Academy we can combine the advanced course with long trips to remote destinations, ask us for details about this combined option.
 
**To take our Advanced Open Water course you must:**
<blockquote>
</p>Be a minimum of 12 years old</p>

<p>Hold an Open Water Diver / Junior Open Water Diver (or equivalent) certification</p>

<p>Please note: The exact depth to which a student will descend during the course depends upon age, but the maximum for an adult is 30 meters/100 feet</p>

#### RESCUE DIVER

The Rescue Diver course will change the way you dive in the best possible way. Learn to identify and fix minor issues before they become big ones, gain confidence, and have some serious fun along the way.
 
Thinking like a rescue diver is taught through a combination of home study and practical skills training set over 2-3 days. Our course is flexible, and highly performance based. You first get to practice basic rescue techniques and then to show how you can apply them effectively in an open water environment (max. water depth for training, 10 m).  **Our version of the course offers a unique extra, courtesy of our co-location with DAN,** a presentation about dive medicine given by Dr. Gabriel Idrobo, a hyperbaric specialist and PADI instructor. For many of our divers this is their favourite  course, providing the knowledge and inspiration to progress a career as a dive Pro.
 
**To take our Rescue Diver course you must:**
<blockquote>
<p>Be a minimum of 12 years old

<p>Hold an Advanced Open Water Diver / Junior Advanced Open Water Diver (or equivalent) certification - with full Underwater Navigation Dive component</p> 

<p>Have received EFR primary and secondary care training (or comparable/qualifying training) within the past 24 months</p>

<p>Please note: If you don't have an EFR certificate and want to take the Rescue Course, we can facilitate EFR co-incident training supplied by the PADI/SSI instructors who manage the island's decompression chamber. What better place could there be to learn!</p>

#### ENRICHED AIR (NITROX)

Enriched air, also known as nitrox or EANx, contains less nitrogen than normal air. Breathing less nitrogen when you’re underwater means you can enjoy longer dives and shorter surface intervals. It's no wonder that Enriched Air courses have become so popular!
 
Online technology makes it easy to take the Enriched Air course, even if you have a busy schedule - complete the knowledge development section of the qualification where and when it is convenient, working at your own pace.  You can connect with your instructor whenever you have a question and after you’ve completed the independent study, they will teach you how to analyse a tank, fill out an enriched air log, and set up your dive computer for nitrox.  Thereafter, you can take two optional dives with your instructor.
 
**To take our enriched air course, you must:**
<blockquote>
<p>Be a minimum of 12 years old</p>

<p>Commit to the 2-4 hours of engagement required for the eLearning component of the course, and the 1-2 days of instructor led training</p>
</blockquote>

#### NIGHT DIVE ADVENTURE

Without a doubt, this is one of our favourite adventures.  The feeling of diving at night is, for, many akin to going to the stars - but instead of going up into outer space you descend to inner space! (Maximum night-time dive depth 13 m / 43 ft).  

No matter how many times you dive a site during daylight hours, when you return there at night you enter a whole new world and watch it come to life beneath the light of your dive torch.  Don’t miss this most magical of dive activities.
 
**To take our Night Dive Adventure you must:**
<blockquote>
<p>Be a minimum of 12 years old</p>

<p>Hold a PADI Open Water Diver qualification (or comparable qualification)</p>

<p>Total time commitment: 1-2 hours</p>
</blockquote>
