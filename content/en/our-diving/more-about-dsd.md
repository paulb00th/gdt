{{< figure src="img/our-diving/more-about/DSD.png" class="align-right full-width-on-small" >}}

Our DSD program is designed to offer your first diving experience, under the supervision of a qualified PADI instructor.  
 
**Here’s a little more information about how we stage the event:**

The day before your trip, we meet in our dive center at 17.00 hrs., to provide you with detailed information about the event and to select and introduce you to the gear you will be using the following day (duration approx. 30 minutes). 
 
On the day of your trip, the itinerary generally follows the model set out below:
 
08.00 hrs or 13.00 hrs, arrive at our office to meet your dive instructor and start your dive adventure. Travel together to the town’s principal dock to board our boat ‘NINA’ and depart for the dive site Punta Estrada[LINK TO: info. In document 2.10 - Our main dive sites].
 
Once we arrive on site, you receive a further dive briefing, get kitted-up and then relax for a brief period before your dive adventure starts (duration approx. 10 minutes)
 
Thereafter, we enter the water and dive for approx. 45 minutes.  
 
Upon completion of the dive, we are collected by the boat and enjoy snacks and drinks before we return you dockside.  Our aim is to have you back in town within about three hours of your departure from our office.  Please note, we also offer 2 tank DSD dives taking approximately 4 hours 30 minutes to complete.
 
**The equipment and additional services we provide for the trip:**

Dive Gear per client: 5- 7mm wetsuit, SCUBA regulator with yoke, BCD, mask, fins, booties, hood (if required), weight belt, and 12 litre tank filled with compressed air. 

Bilingual instructor/guide
