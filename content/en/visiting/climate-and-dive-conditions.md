#### The local climate and dive conditions

The weather on the islands is classified as subtropical, with two main seasons:
 
**Warm season - January to May**
During this period the southeast winds slacken, warmer water from the Panama Basin moves in, the skies clear and the temperature rises.  There is a far more tropical feel at this time of year, including some occasional downpours!
 
Average: 27°-32° C (80°-90°F), Periodic rain. A good time to visit for sunshine and warm, calmer seas.
 
**Cool season (June to September)**  
 
Known locally as the Garùa (misty) season, this part of the year sees generally cool air, often with foggy skies and choppy seas - under the influence of the Humboldt Current and the southeast trade winds. During this cool, period, the islands usually receive no more than 10 mm of rain per month.

Average 15°-21° C (60°-70° F), mornings are often misty.  Good time to visit for increased underwater animal activity.
 
**The short season**
As indicated by the months covered above, there is another brief component to the year, during which the Galapagos experiences a short dry season (October to December).
 
Average 21°-27° C (70°-80°F).  Good time to visit for mild weather, combining land and underwater activities.

#### Sea Temperatures (Average)
 
•    January – June: average 21°-27°C (70°-80°F)
 
•    July – December: average 18°-23°C (65°-75°F)
 
Depending upon the season during which you visit, we provide 5 to 7mm wetsuits, so that there’s no shivering!  In the cooler seasons we also provide accessories such as hoods.  If you are not used to cold seas or if you feel the cold more than most, please feel free to bring an extra base layer (although we do keep a few spares on hand).

If you plan to snorkel, we recommend using a 3mm wetsuit during the cooler period of the year and a dive skin during the warmer period.  You can rent these locally or bring your own.

#### Visibility
On average, visibility in the Galapagos is between 8 and 10m (25ft to 35ft) with an increase to some 18m (60ft) on good days.  If you’re used to 20, 30, 40 or 50 m of visibility, don’t worry, a unique aspect of the Galapagos is that its wildlife is both abundant and curious - you will find yourself diving close to sea lions, sharks, rays and other animals and the ‘difficulty’ will be choosing where to look, not the vis!
