<span class="strapline">This might help!</span>

{{< figure src="img/visiting/Travel-docs.png" class="align-right full-width-on-small" >}}

Regardless of whether you arrive in the islands during the hot or cold season, the essential items you require are likely to be as follows:

**Essentials**

Passport

Travel and accommodation documents

Cash and cards

Insurance documentation

Small backpack for water, towel, food, camera, etc.

Re-fillable, preferably recycled, water bottle

Dry Bag – *if you plan on using day boats for outings*

Camera and significant extra storage i.e., additional SD cards (preferably an underwater camera). *Options here are limited and expensiv*e

Sunhat with strap, as you’re going to be on the equator! *Although, some prefer a sun umbrella as a cooler option*

Sunglasses *(polarized if spending a lot of time on the water)*

Windbreaker/Light weight rain jacket, it can get cool in the mornings and out on a boat. *Misty rain in the cold season and morning downpours in the hot season are common*

Insect Repellent and Sunscreen, minimum 50 factor if you burn easily

Some lightweight, light coloured, breathable clothes, inc. shorts, t-shirts and longer garments to counter the mosquitos in the evenings!

Walking shoes/boots and comfortable sandals - *some people bring the water-resistant type which are great for all tours*

Essential medicines and toiletry kit

 

**If you are diving/snorkelling**

Bathing suit/s

Mask & snorkel

Perhaps an exposure suit lycra rash vest, neoprene skin, or similar - *it’s easy to burn in/on the water*

Perhaps also your full dive kit - *but note all this gear can be rented once you’re here!*
