<span class="strapline">Conservation - In our name and in out ethos!</span>

We offer a wide variety of expert-taught programs, ranging from introductory courses to scuba specialties, first aid training, and professional certification.  

Our qualifications, all endorsed by PADI, the Professional Association of Diving Instructors, allow you to dive anywhere in the world but, with Galapagos Dive Training & Conservation, that’s not where it ends.  

While you are with us in the richly inhabited Galapagos Marine Reserve, you will also learn about the islands’ conservation programmes and the citizen science initiatives to which you can contribute.

Whether you’re new to diving or already qualified, our commitment to continuing education will enhance your skills and broaden your knowledge base.
