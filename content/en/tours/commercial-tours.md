##### Day-tours verses multi-day activities?
We are regularly asked by visitors whether multi-day trips/cruises or day tours are the better option.  The truth is both have a lot to offer.

The positive side of some cruise boats is that they take you to islands that cannot be visited during one-day tours. On the other hand, some day vessels visit the same sites as the cruise ships.  Bear in mind also that when cruising, you are on a multiday break, so your trip has no set pause points while its ongoing and is perhaps more relaxing.
   
Day tours, on the other hand, are usually done by 5pm, so you’re back to your hotel each evening and able to stroll around the town to look for dinner and a drink.  And, of course, if you are not naturally comfortable on a boat, you don’t feel awful throughout your whole trip!

The decision really depends on your viewpoint and your budget.  Just bear in mind that the two options provide for very different experiences.
