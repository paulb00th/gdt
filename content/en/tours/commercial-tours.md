### TOURS - Multiday land & water-based excursions

Besides day trips, you can undertake longer excursions while in the islands, allowing you to get more out of your time in the archipelago. Typical of these are 4-, 5- and 8-day adventures with titles such as ‘Discover the best of Galapagos’. These types of experience can be styled to suit almost any budget.
